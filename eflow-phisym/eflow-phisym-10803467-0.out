Some automation commands require a valid grid proxy.
For those the automation T0 API is expecting a path to a VOMS proxy file in the X509_USER_PROXY environment variable which is set to '/pool/condor/dir_1669809/grid_proxy.x509'.
If needed, the file itself can be generated e.g. with 'voms-proxy-init --voms cms --out $HOME/grid_proxy.x509' before starting the singularity container.
Alternatively, the X509_USER_PROXY environment variable can be set to point to an existing VOMS proxy file.
